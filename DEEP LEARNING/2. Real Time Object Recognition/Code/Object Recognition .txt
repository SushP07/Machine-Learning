OBJECT RECOGNITION:


	Relu- Rectified Linear Unit. It acts as a catalyst to accelerate the training speed because of its derivative property.
	IMPLEMENTING:
		1.PRE-TRAINED MODEL(NO DATASET)
			  i]MobileNet-SSD
				- Based on depth wise seperable convolutions
				- dsc applies single layer to input and pointwise convolution provides 1*1 to combines the output.
				- 
			 ii]Googlenet 
			iii]Faster-R-CNN
			 iv]YOLO
			
		2.TRANSFER LEARNING
		3.BUILDING FROM SCRATCH


LOADING IMAGE FROM DISK TO DNN:
blob=cv2.dnn.BlobFromImage(resizedImg,scalingFactor,SpatialSize,MeanSubtraction)

Importing model from various Framework:

cv2.dnn.createCaffeImporter
cv2.dnn.createTensorflowImporter

cv2.dnn.readFromCaffe
cv2.dnnreadFromTensorFlow


It identifies only those objects which it is trained for. There are 15 objects. If object for which it is not shown it shows Bottle as the output.
