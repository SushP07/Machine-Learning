# Machine-Learning
In this repository you will find the different libraries I used and ML and DL concepts. This repository will be subdivided according to the ML and DL projects.
Kindly note that OpenCv folder is just for projects which are built by using Opencv libraries alone with its dependencies and not with other libraries such as Tensorflow or Keras.

Those projects are work of internship project with Pantech Solutions. Credit goes to them for providing the code. I modified it according to my convinience and used Jupyter Notebook to divide the code properly and run partwise to find error in steps.

Thank you.
