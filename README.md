# Machine-Learning
In this repository you will find different libraries I used with ML and DL concepts. This repository will be subdivided according to the ML and DL projects.
Kindly note that OpenCv folder is just for projects which are built by using Opencv library used for Computer Vision alone with its dependencies and not with other libraries such as Tensorflow or Keras.

Those projects are work of internship project with Pantech Solutions. Credit goes to them for providing the code. I modified it according to my convenience and used Jupyter Notebook to divide the code properly and run partwise to find error in steps.

I will provide readme files for each file with information about libraries used and functions associated with them. 

Thank you.
